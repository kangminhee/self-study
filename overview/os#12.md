# Locality and The Fast File System
OSTEP 41: Locality and The Fast File System

### UFS: unix file system

|S|i-nodes|Data|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|

- super block(S): information about the entire file system(of a partition)

*UFS's performance was terrible*
- treated the disk like it was a random-access memory; inducing an expensive seek
- its block size was too small
- distance between the i-node and its data blocks was too large

### UFS: fast file system

*FFS*
- devides the disk into a bunch of groups known as cylinder groups(block groups)
- each group has...
    - S(super block)
    - ib(inode bitmap)
    - db(data bitmap)
    - inodes block region
    - data block region

# Crash Consistency: FSCK and Journaling

### *CRUX: how to update the disk despite crashes*

when a file is modified
- the inode is updated
- the data block are updated
- the data bitmap is updated

the crash consistency problem
is related to the synchronization between the inode and the data bitmap
