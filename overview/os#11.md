# Hard Disk Drives

### *CRUX: How to store and access data on disk*
- how do modern hard-disk drives store data?
- what is the interface?
    - IDE(integrated drive electronics): defines the connection between a bus and the disk storage devices [link](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/IDE)
    - SCSI
    - SATA
- how is the data actually laid out and accessed?
- how does disk scheduling improve performance?

### modern disks
- platter: a circular hard surface on which data is stored persistently by inducing magnetic changes to it
- spindle: spin the platters at a constant rate(RPM)
- track: concetric circle of sectors(where data encoded)
- disk head: reading/writing from the surface
- disk arm: locates the disk head over the desired track
- sector: numbered from 0 to n-1 | 0 to n-1 is address space of the drive

### I/O Time
- (seek time) + (rotational delay) + (transfer time)
    - seek time: move the disk arm to the correct track
    - 4 phases of the seek: acceleration, coasting, deceleration, settling
    - rotational delay
    - transfer

### cache
- write-back caching(immediate reporting): used when data be written to disk in a certain order for correctness
- write-through caching: faster but can be dangerous(correctness)

### *CRUX: how to handle disk starvation*
- how can we implement SSTF-like scheduling but avoid starvation?

### disk scheduling
- FIFO: first in first out
- SSTF: shortest seek time first
    - starvation problem
- Elevator (a.k.a. SCAN C-SCAN)
    - SCAN
    - SCAN-LOOK
    - C-SCAN(circular scan)
